## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atoms
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ InfoCard.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SearchBar.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ UvCard.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WeatherCard.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WindCard.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useGeolocationStore.js
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useWeather.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ molecules
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WeatherCarrusel.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ organism
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ExtraWeaterInfo.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WeatherInfo.jsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
